      <h3><u>About Bhopal :</u></h3>
      <p>
        Known as the City of Lakes, Bhopal is the capital of Madhya Pradesh.
        Founded by Raja Bhoj, the city has many natural and artificial lakes and
        it is one of the greenest cities in the country. Bhopal has retained its
        old world charm despite industrialization, with the old part of the city
        being full of narrow alleyways and crammed markets, while the new part
        of the city is better planned and is full of parks and gardens.
      </p>

      <p>
        The city has been a place where Hindus and Muslims have coexisted
        harmoniously over the years and it is reflected in the cuisine too. Both
        vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes are available here, but Bhopalâ€™s
        spicy meat delicacies, especially the curries and kebabs, are a result
        of the Mughal influence. The vegetarian cuisine is mostly mildly spicy
        and has a distinct taste to it.
